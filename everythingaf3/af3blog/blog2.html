                <p>These artworks were made after 1980, did not present as a perspective fitting with the theme, or otherwise are not related to course subjects like cubism, futurism, or surrealism, pop, and other cultural subject matter.</p>

                <img src="../../assets/images/thebody3.png" alt="3 pieces of Rachaph." data-aos="fade-up"><br>
                <p>This is Rachaph by Minjeong An, made in 2024. Because of the time period, this piece was not selected, but its abstract and detailed linework and typopgraphy made it a phenomenal candidate for this exhibit. It would most likely go under the category of abstract depiction, showing the extreme details and facets of a person and their body through intricate linework and notes. The use of a 2-dimensional plane to flatten a body into a raw and abstract form was appealing, even despite there being no physical beauty or aesthetical appeal in terms of traditional portrayals of the human body.</p><br>
                <h2>Roy Lichtenstein, Drowning Girl, 1963.</h2>
                <img src="../../assets/images/drowninggirl.jpeg" alt="A full shot of Drowning Girl by Roy Lichtenstein." data-aos="fade-up"><br>
                <p>This is Drowning Girl by Roy Lichtenstein, made in 1963. It is a great example of pop art and even comic art during the 60's, and was seen as a simplified and abstracted way to depict the human body. However, a choice between this stylized depiction and Dogs of Cythera resulted in the selection of Dogs of Cythera because of the vastly distorted, fun, and challenging parts of that piece. This piece is a great runner-up for a stylized and emotional depiction of the human body.</p><br>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>In this week’s blog, I’ve decided to focus on a thrilling new exhibition that has opened at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City! It was titled, “The Multifaceted Perception of the Body”, which put together 5 works from the 20th century – and an overview of the small exhibit went over complex ideas of the human body and experience.</p>

                <h2>The Overview</h2>
                <p>Over many centuries of changing societies, standards, and environments, people have become much more aware of the way bodies interact with their environment and respond to it -- but they also have refined their perceptions of bodies, leading artists to develop stylized sculptures, paintings, sketches, and conceptual art with varying meanings and renditions of the human body. While some take a more abstract core idea and express it through emotions and experiences, others may choose to express the human body in its rawest state. Some artists choose to express the body as a vessel for experiences, on a mental and physical level, while others express it as a state of being and living, among other living and non-living things. Artists have the choice of depicting what they see, and some depict what they feel. This brief exhibition, art will come from different perspectives and reasons... but feature the exact same overall subject visually, in some way.</p><br>
                <p>These 5 pieces, featuring artists from France, Sudan, and the United States from the 1910's, 1920's, 1970's, and 1980's all have 1 essential quality that brings them together in this exhibit -- the presence of one or more bodies, recognizable by faces, physique, or both. These bodies are shown for varied purposes, and represent the individual purposes they intended on fulfilling. Many paintings, for example, were created as studies of the diverse human form, done by artists of all skill levels to hone their ability to portray the body. In many works prior to the 20th century, this goal of accuracy was the most prominent one for artists. However, as time changed, and new movements and ideas began to flourish, ideas of altered bodies, abstract bodies, out-of-body spiritual experiences, and other subject matter spread out like an interconnected web. They all presented experience and ideas, but were executed in different ways.</p><br>
                <p>Functionality and ergonomics is one common modern subject that is interested in the most optimized form of the human body with objects, furniture, and architecture. Futurism is another that focuses on the advancement of humanity and the creation of machines that either visually cater to serving their purposes, or adheres to recognizable forms and figures for comfort. Spirituality is an abstract concept that is also present in this exhibition, and the idea of a spirit or soul inhabiting a body and giving it a different form of life is an ancient but more deeply rooted idea. The depiction of bodies and forms stretches beyond simply capturing the entity in paint or other media. It becomes an experience and challenge for the artist, to see what can be expressed, and finding the best method of expressing it.</p><br>
                <p><i>Life is short and sweet, our bodies like a boat channeling impulses, experience, and energy to go through the ups and downs of life.</i>All ideas, negative and positive, sweet and somber, or neutral and grey, are somehow felt, in different ways, stages, and forms. This exhibit means to take a seemingly unrelated set of works, and bring them together through one overarching visual marker.</p>

                <p><i>Arthur B. Davies, The Wine Press, 1918. 32 1/4 x 24 1/4" (81.9 x 61.6 cm), oil on canvas.</i></p>
                <p>When the subject of capturing the human body is mentioned, compositions such as The Wine Press will immediately flash in the minds of most people. It is seen as the simplest task. Capturing the human body often is thought to be a process that features diligent work and extensive knowledge of anatomy, perspective, color, and other core fundamentals of art. It also creates a final product that can be recognized as a person, even if that depiction of a person, real or not, exists on a 2-dimensional, non-living plane. The relation of art and science in both art from centuries ago and now is strictly intertwined. Artists in eras prior to the 20th century often focused mainly on composing the best works with the human body, and ensuring that accuracy and flexibility was one of their goals in the development process. Proportions, color, blending, and efficient capturing of the human form were all crucial factors that needed (and still need) to be considered.</p><br>
                <p>Why are portraits, nudes, anatomical studies, and other captured facets of the human body so appealing? After all, we "...are irresistibly drawn to looking at our fellow human beings with a sustained intensity and complexity accorded to no other field of visual activity," intrigued by both the accuracy, and also the typical wonders of observing another person. In this painting, there is a sense of fluidity and joy. By looking and understanding posture and body cues, we can ascertain this emotional state of the person, and there clearly are psychological attributes to artworks with bodies and figures in them. Furthermore, the androgynous figure is in an intriguing pose, with two hands in the composition, as if talking or moving to be engaged in conversation or action. Viewers may attach a belief of beauty and peace, even despite any imperfections in the painting. While the artist, Arthur B. Davies, was an American, he was an artist active in both the United States and Europe. He took inspiration and ideas from fauvism and cubism, yet adhered to a style that was reminiscent of romanticism, with distinct color choices and expressive, soft, and warm blending. He took an older route with new ideas, and utilized the fun of his experience of capturing his model with the natural appeal of a human body.</p><br>

                <p><i>Fernand Léger, Three Women, 1921-22. 6' 1/4" x 8' 3" (183.5 x 251.5 cm), oil on canvas.</i></p>
                <p>During the 20th century, various forms of expression and art began to pop up in Europe and the United States. Fauvism, expressionism, and cubism are 3 notable starts to the more conceptual and abstract styles of art. In Three Women, Léger uses the style of cubism to execute a futuristic idea of life and environments with machines and human beings together. In this piece, all of the faces and forms are recognizable, however they are stoic, expressionless, and less appealing than what norms dictate as beautiful and approachable. He takes a more neutral and devoid approach to capturing the human body. At its core, it is less functional and more problematic than using, for example, machines or other tools. Léger does not see the value in any sentimental, emotional, or psychological way of capturing the human body and rather takes attributes from physical exaggeration and abstraction to express his ideas. There is no interest in simply using the human body as the beautiful and unique figure, and lets the environment speak for it instead. The same interest that exists in human figures for other works draws us into Three Women, and keeps us there to try and decipher Léger’s choices and emotionless faces.</p><br>
                <p>In works like these, the direction is not to connect with the figures in any kind of way, but rather to take an approach to the environment and the purpose of making the figures as stoic as they are. Some may see this artwork as the artist's way of showing peace and tranquility to lives shaken by World War I. There are now two perspectives that come from different people who may try to justify their own bias or ideas about why the piece appears to have no action or is devoid of any beautiful or meaningful action! Some may see the scene as tranquil and casual despite the lack of emotion, while others may see it as a futuristic neglect and a complete detachment from any emotional or psychological attributes.</p><br>

                <p><i>Henry Dreyfuss, Joe and Josephine, 1955 (Life-size versions made in 1960). Offset lithograph.</i></p>
                <p>In Joe and Josephine,  this work attempts and succeeds at capturing an overall completely neutral and mathematical perspective of the human body. While the previous entries discussed the presence of an aesthetical or scientific view of the human body and the absence of emotional and psychological feelings in a body, a mathematical capturing of the human body is what this work embodies. Anatomical perspective and accuracy is something that is often studied, but not necessarily with math and rather with gross anatomy dissection and other more scientific based methods of observation. This is a more logical execution of an artist capturing the physical attributes of a human body even if the posing and expressions are not present.</p><br>
                <p>This work is a capturing of the 50th percentile of people, and was created for the design industry in order to create furniture, tools, objects, and other necessities that would be comfortable to use for a large majority of people. Despite these 2 figures having no emotional or psychological attachment, like the previous work, they have a different purpose and are essentially reminders of the concept that various industries design not just for aesthetics or beauty, but for the people that use their products and keep them in business. This is a secondary perspective to the neutral and otherwise standard depiction of the human body, and yet its overarching purpose is entirely mathematical and logical for the needs of people.</p><br>
                <p>The use of mathematics in art and vice-versa has also been an age-old technique and produced various iconic references, studies, and pieces. The proportions of the human body, which can vary for many, but otherwise adheres to common ratios and values based in mathematics. Who would have thought that there is such a diverse potential in something that is seen as constraining or limiting to art?</p><br>

                <p><i>Dorothea Tanning, Chiens de Cythère (Dogs of Cythera), 1963. 77 1/2" x 117" (196.9 x 297.2cm), oil on canvas.</i></p>
                <p>How long does it take for you to connect all of the unique forms together in this painting? Can you recognize arms, faces, torsos, legs? Can you see appendages, body parts, and other recognizable parts of the human body, just not all together in their right places? This conceptual artwork played with fragmentation, distortion, and abstraction (but not in the Cubist style!) by blending and breaking apart the human body. It became a challenge to express a mix of confusion and shock with fun and interest. This is a surrealist piece, one that leans into the odd breaking and detailing of the human body, and it was not only a hard hurdle to overcome on Tanning’s end, but now it is a confusing and intriguing experience for the viewers.</p><br>
                <p>The many ways in which the human body can be recognized is often shocking. There is not one full and complete body in Dogs of Cythera – all of the forms are just noticed pieces and fragments of the whole, strewn in a fashion that pulls the viewer’s eyes throughout the composition. In this case, this perspective abstracts the human body and challenges our perception of the body to try and understand the flow of the piece. While there is no true conceptual or contextual purpose, other than continuously creating forms and producing a surreal challenge through well-blended forms and pieces, there is a factor that makes it all the more intriguing to observe.</p><br>
                <p>At this point, we have now delved into a facet of artists depicting the human body and experience with the intention of playing with the mind of the viewer. There is no concrete mathematical, proportional, or logical purpose, and the emotions are all in the twisting and fragmented pieces of the body loosely held together around the piece. The viewer wields those emotions, and this unique and abstract perception of the parts of a human body is what brings this piece together with the varied presentations of a figure.</p><br>

                <p><i>Kamala Ibrahim Ishag, Untitled, 1980/1990. 70 7/8 × 69 11/16" (180 × 177 cm), oil on canvas.</i></p>
                <p>This fifth and final piece comes from a spiritual and cultural context, that speaks through an artist reconstructing an experience and the undeniably incomprehensible wonders of consciousness and spirituality. This abstract rendition of the body comes from both a curious learning experience of a psychological and mental experience, and uses notable parts of the human figure to depict that experience in a 2-dimensional medium. What is crucial about this piece is the fact that there is a significant amount of context regarding the shown experience, the cultural choice for creating this piece, and the roots art has overall to culture and perception. To be straightforward, this piece renders several people who are significantly abstracted – still visible and understandable enough to perceive as people, but enough abstraction to understand that there are stylistic choices being made to show the experience as it is.</p><br>
                <p>Ishag’s curiosity in altered conscious experiences led many years of research and artistic experimentation to create this piece showing trances of women possessed by the “zār” spirit, notably during rituals that take place as a result of cult activity in Sudan. Trances and other spiritually-rooted activities are extremely complex. Many people never have a spiritual experience, but in many cultures around the world, spirituality is critical to bonding with family, community, and even history. Therefore, Ishag’s interest in these subjects is not unheard of, nor uncommon. Consciousness and perception are two crucial parts of the human experience, and by using art to represent those distinct experiences, one can try to connect to the sensations and mental attributes that are felt by those who have gone through them.</p><br>
                <p>To wrap up, this piece represents a cultural context that led to the use of art and abstraction to present the human body in a way that attempts to build a bridge with viewers into a foreign experience!</p><br>

                <h2>How it All Ties Together</h2>
                <p>This exhibition has gone through many perspectives. Some rooted in culture, some in design, some in history, and some in logic. So what is the overall feature that leads to this collection of 20th century art being grouped in this way? It is the prominence of the body, and the presence in each piece. Parts, full figures, and various abstracted or mathematically-focused depictions of the body. This exhibit features works that are stylistically varied, including cubism, surrealism, and even futurism. Industry-based graphic design and fine art are included in this diverse mix, and understanding several perspectives of depicting the human figure is what makes people trying to understand or express their ideas and experiences all the more intriguing. </p><br>
                <p>Whether it be strict pen, thickly layered brush strokes, or fine detailing, the execution is still recognized by viewers, and that captures the intention of each artist. Overall, while the subject matter and context varies, they all come together by using and showing the human body for their own communicative purposes, whether it be informational, beautiful, or neither!</p><br>
                <p>The human body is often used most for depicting experiences, emotions, and sensations, not just because it is directly related, but because the human mind’s ability to comprehend and recognize imagery allows viewers to connect with artwork.</p><br>
