            <h2>What is Art Fight?</h2>
            <p>Art Fight is an annual online art game that brings together a huge creative community. It involves two teams battling against each other through the creation of artwork—called "attacks." Players draw characters submitted by participants from the opposing team to score points. Each year, the event runs for a month, typically in July, and attracts thousands of artists globally.<br>

            <h2>My Participation</h2>
            <p>July 2024 marked my first official participation in Art Fight, and it was an exhilarating experience! I joined the game to challenge myself creatively and connect with fellow artists in this large, energetic community.</p>
            <h3>Attacks and Friendly Fire</h3>
            <p>I found myself enjoying both attack and friendly fire drawings, which allowed me to experiment with different styles and techniques while interpreting other people's characters. <br>
            During the event, I created:<br>
            <i>15 attacks on members of the opposing team, and</i><br>
            <i>9 friendly fire pieces, where I drew characters of members from my own team.</i></p>
            <h3>Point Accumulation</h3>
            <p>By the end of the month, I was proud to have accumulated over 1100 points. This was a significant achievement for me, considering the time and effort put into each piece. Points are awarded based on factors like detail, effort, and creativity, making it even more rewarding to see the total rise as the event progressed.</p>
            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Art Fight 2024 was an amazing opportunity to push myself artistically while also contributing to a larger community. I connected with fellow creators and developed new skills. If you’re an artist looking for a challenge and a way to connect with others, I highly recommend jumping into Art Fight next year!<br>
